                <p>This project is from 2024 CAS Computer Science at Crossroads School for the Arts & Sciences. The
                    creater is Alek Golubchik, an 11th Grade student. In this
                    project, I used Teachable Machine, a website that creates machine learning models to create my own
                    practical model. To do this, I created a Teachable Machine model, which differentiated between
                    Polish ZÅ‚oty, US Dollars, and Ukrainian Hryvnia. This is a critical tool as it could help different
                    people identify
                    which currencies they could use in these countries, including the current exchange rate. </p>

                <p>I would like to firstly and foremost thank Paul Way, the professor of this CAS Computer Science
                    course. Mr. Way has taught me about all the essential coding techniques to successfully complete
                    this project as well as foster my passion and understanding of general computer science.
                    Additionally, I would like to thank the developers of Teachable Machine for easily allowing me
                    to
                    create a machine learning model without spending countless hours creating and editing my own
                    code.
                    I would like to thank W3Schools for providing me with basic codes that served as a base
                    for
                    the rest of my project and providing me support in times of distress. Thank you to all others
                    not
                    yet mentioned. Finally, I would like to thank the great countries of the United States of America,
                    Poland, and Ukraine for protecting me and giving me such powerful cultures.</p>
